One of the most powerful components of go templates is the ability to stack actions one after another. This is done by using pipes. 


## Head 1
Borrowed from unix pipes, the concept is simple, each pipeline's output becomes the input of the following pipe.

Because of the very simple syntax of go templates, the pipe is essential to being able to chain together function calls. One limitation of the pipes is that they only can work with a single value and that value becomes the last parameter of the next pipeline.

A few simple examples should help convey how to use the pipe.

Code sample
```js
 
/ab/.test("new");
function newF(){
  var x=0;
  for(var i=0;i<x;i++){
    console.log(i+x);
  }
}
```

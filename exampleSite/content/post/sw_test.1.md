One of the most powerful components of go templates is the ability to stack actions one after another. This is done by using pipes. 


## Head 1
Borrowed from unix pipes, the concept is simple, each pipeline's output becomes the input of the following pipe.

Because of the very simple syntax of go templates, the pipe is essential to being able to chain together function calls. One limitation of the pipes is that they only can work with a single value and that value becomes the last parameter of the next pipeline.

How about *something in italics, does that give enough contract?* or you need to go for a **bold face to make an impact** on readers attention? 

A few simple examples should help convey how to use the pipe.

## Head 2
Borrowed from unix pipes, the concept is simple, each pipeline's output becomes the input of the following pipe.

Because of the very simple syntax of go templates, the pipe is essential to being able to chain together function calls. One limitation of the pipes is that they only can work with a single value and that value becomes the last parameter of the next pipeline.

Introducing links [in between a big paragraph](/may/ "Added title for interesting leads") can also be a styling issue as it needs enough contrast away from the surrounding text to be able to stand out of the crowd and pull the readers attention. While it is [good to have visited links styled separately to show someone already visited a URL](/may "not mandatory though"). 
A few simple examples should help convey how to use the pipe.

A list for flavor:

* No sequence 
* Some queue
* Blank page

A numbered list

1. One file
2. Two themes
3. Three Progressive Web Apps with Reliable, Fast and Progressive enhancements.
4. And another long line of text that may be running for multiple lines again
5. Another small line

A code that will be very long `starting from here until the end of the earth and back home until eternity`. 

Or this `input:not([type=radio]).not(.required)` on mobile.
Code sample
```js
 
/ab/.test("new");
function newF(){
  var x=0;
  for(var i=0;i<x;i++){
    console.log(i+x, "printing secret", "long text");
  }
}
```

Finally, a table:

Header Value 1 | Header Value 2
-----|-----
`some code` | and its description from the deep shadows of internet that no one has ever seen.
`another term` | that everyone dreads using on their own computer but uses it across the board anyways
`what if the command itself is too long` | while the description is short.

Finally an image:
